## reactjs
 ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs). 
 It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them when the underlying data changes. 
 React uses a virtual DOM to optimize UI updates and follows a component-based architecture. 
 It is known for its simplicity, performance optimizations, and a thriving ecosystem of libraries and tools.

In this repo project, I have a small documentation and the mini projects I am building throught my learning and revising 
my react concepts.
